# Arsy's Rather Simple Yatter

Starting in the early 2000s and lasting until 2009, I kept a personal blog named after my computer username 'arsy', a recursive acronym for <i>Arsy's Rather Simple Yatter</i>.  I liked the domain name, `arsy.org` because it was four letters long and had a slight edge to it.

In general, I wrote about life, motorcycles, gardening, music and more.  The blog kept me close with a small group of friends.  It was the 'social network' of the time, but without algoritms and ads.  Compared to the networks today, blogging with friends at the time seemed so innocent.

This period of time included the birth of my first two children, September 9-11 and the transition between multiple jobs, ultimately, ending when I moved to France.  
 
Here's a list of a few select posts, that I find nostaglic and worthy of listing.
