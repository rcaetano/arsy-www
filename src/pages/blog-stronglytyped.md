# Strongly Typed

From around 2000 until 2007 I hosted a programming blog named StronglyTyped.  Since my childhood,I've enjoyed programming and was absorbed into programming culture.  From this experience, I eventually developed my own personal opinions about programming langauages, which eventualy led to this name.  

Languages that offer "strong typing" offer many benefits for software developers.  For example, if we wanted to count some thing, we could declare a variable "x" and define it as a number.  Later, if we wanted to try and store a person's name in "x", the computer would know in advanced that this is not possible.  Strongly typed languages help to reduce bugs and make it easier for developers to not break things.


I hosted the blog with th domain stronglytyped.com from around 2000 until 2007.  If I remember correctly, it was originally built with a product called CityDesk from Fog Creek Software in NYC.  Later I migrated over to Blogger where this archive was imported from.

During those years, I developed close friendships through the blog.  To name and than a few of them : Ben Padilla, Bobby Meneses, Cass McNutt, Daved Kuns, Justin Stolle, Ingo Rammer, Kevin Medeiros, Paul Harrington, Rob Fahrni, Tim Torian and Tyler Love.
