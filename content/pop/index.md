# The Proof of Process Whitepaper

The 2008 financial crisis showed how lack of visibility between the real estate, finance and insurance industries manifested as a global meltdown.  In 2013, [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/schools-brief/2013/09/07/crash-course) writes:

> "With half a decadeâ€™s hindsight, it is clear the crisis had multiple causes. The most obvious is the financiers themselves... who claimed to have found a way to banish risk when in fact they had simply lost track of it."

Surely, lack of business traceability is a systemic risk.

Proof of Process is a protocol designed to improve trust between people and organiations.  By offering digital tracceablity of business data, documents and actions, actors relying on the same process can act with accountability.
